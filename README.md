open-schema-tool
================
When completed, this tool will allow the State Department to create 
easily shareable data schemas, replacing actual data with bogus data. 
Readability will be maintained - bogus data will not consist of random 
strings numbers or strings. Numbers will be numbers, strings will be strings, 
names will be names, dates will be dates, and locations will be locations. 
However, all data will be fake, no just random.

After a dataset is input by State, the output file can be distributed. By 
making data schemas shareable, we increase opportunities for creating open 
source tools and public collaboration.

In many cases, it isn't the "tool" that is sensistive - it is the data.
